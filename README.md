# Movie_View_Time_Prediction
This project developed a model to predict Movie view time for an on-line ecommerce platform

Applied python packages and visulaization tools for data exploration and reature engineering

Trained the models by applying both linear models(Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression) and non-linear models(Random Forest,SVM) to predict  cumulated view time per day of a movie.

Performed model evaluation, analyzed feature importance to gain business insights.
